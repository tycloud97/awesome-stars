Also several malpractices still exist in the system just due to lack of a transparent and immutable system. Therefore, we propose a Blockchain based solution to curb the flaws of the existing system.  BLOCKCHAIN BASED REAL ESTATE PROPERTY REGISTRATION APP :  A smart app for property registration and ownership tracking. The property value and owner is stored on blockchain and features like change of ownership is easily reflected through this mechanism. Administrators with varying degree of controls like User, Admin, Superadmin secure the governance.  The smart contracts are developed for the ethereum blockchain which is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts.  Technical Details :  High Level Languages for smart developing contract :  Solidity  Command Line Tool for creating a DAPP project : Truffle  Testnode with RPC Interface for deploying contracts on a virtual node and make transactions without the need to be mined:  Browser based IDE to get instant feedback for solidity code: ReMix | varshanipreddy | 13 |

The project uses Ethereum block-chain based distributed computing platform, which is an API for building decentralized(server-less) application on which data can be stored as well as computation can be performed.  We coded up a smart contract(in Solidity, a language for block-chain apps) with javascript on the front end for users to enter data and into the block-chain and also perform transactions on the block-chain which get reflected in almost real time(after they get mined!) on the ropsten network. | Madhu-Vamsi | 28 |
